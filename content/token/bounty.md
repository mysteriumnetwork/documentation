Being a part of the Mysterium Network Node Pilot means you join us in the research phase of our project. So expect rapid changes to bounty rules.

We are going to be introducing two bounties for the Month of March. These rules come into effect on the 1st of March 2020 and will affect your payout in April.

1. [Residential IP bounties with payout caps and rolling payments + New countries 🇦🇺🇳🇱](#residential-ip-bounties-with-payout-caps-and-rolling-payments)
2. [Top 3 nodes / region bounties 🌍](#top-3-node--region-global-bounty)

Important Definitions:

**MYSTT** - Test tokens used to calculate the usage of your node.

**Residential IP** - An IP address tied to a physical device, in our case Raspberry Pis [preferred for Mysterium Network and a higher likelihood of earning], desktops or mobile phones.

And with that, here is our proposal for March Node Pilot bounty rules:

### Residential IP bounties with payout caps and rolling payments

Our first node pilot bounty rule will only apply to **residential IPs in the following regions: UK, US, Italy, Germany, Australia and Netherlands.**

In March 2020, nodes will no longer earn by availability. Instead, **you will earn by data transmitted through your node and session time**. As your node transmits data, you will begin to earn MYSTT.

MYSTT functions like points. Earnings will be calculated by the amount of MYSTT accumulated by your node at the end of the month.

We will be capping the number of nodes paid out per target region. In each of these regions, if you are running a residential IP you can earn **up to $50** calculated using the MYSTT you accumulate. For the month of March, MYSTT will be calculated such that 1 MYSTT = USD $1. **If you do not earn enough MYSTT in the first month to get a payout, your accumulated MYSTT will be transferred to the next month.** This means that you will stand a higher chance of being one of the top nodes in your region in month two. Once you get paid, your MYSTT value will go back to zero for the following month.

**We will have a total cap of 250 nodes paid out for the following regions: the UK, US, Italy, Germany, Australia, Netherlands.**

When it comes to residential IPs, we may add more countries or change limits. We will provide you with 2-week notice in the case of upcoming changes. Regions are chosen based on the interest expressed by network users.

**For example** - *John has been running a node in the UK for the past 2 months. At the beginning of the month of March, the number of MYSTT accumulated in his account will be zero. Over the course of the month, John will offer a VPN service from his node to end-users and to whitelisted traffic within the network. This will start to earn him MYSTT. At the end of March, John earns a total of 100 MYSTT.*

*Scenario A: If John is among the top 100 nodes [calculated by the total amount of MYSTT earned], he will be eligible for the bounty. He will collect his payout and start month two with zero MYSTT.*

*Scenario B: If John does not earn enough MYSTT to be one of the top 100 in the UK, his 100 MYSTT will roll over to month two. Let’s say John earns another 120 MYSTT in month two. This brings him to a total of 220 MYSTT accumulated over the two months. In month two John is within the top 100 nodes in the UK based on his total of 220 MYSTT. He will be able to collect his payout for the month. Once he collects his payout, his MYSTT balance will fall to zero on month three.*

**To reiterate: MYSTT will be calculated such that 1 MYSTT = USD $1. Each payout will be capped at $50/ node.**

** We will be adding a KYC layer for node runners earning more than $200. When your earning hits $200 within my.mysterium.network, you will be prompted to enter our KYC process and provide details. If you are not interested in going through KYC, the maximum payout regardless of total earnings will be $200.*

### Top 3 node / region global bounty

Our second node pilot bounty rule will apply to **all types of IPs in all regions of the world.**

**We are opening our pilot to every country in the world.** Here nodes with any type of IP are eligible to earn [Residential IP, Data Centre IP, etc]. To be eligible you must have an identifiable IP address and verification of your geolocation checked against [Maxmind](https://www.maxmind.com/en/home).

For this bounty, we will only pay the top 3 performing nodes per region. Top 3 node earnings are capped at $10. If you are already participating in our “Residential IP bounties with payout caps and rolling payments” this is a way for you to earn an extra $10.

How will this be calculated? Once you connect your node you will begin earning MYSTT in exchange for data usage. MYSTT functions like points. The three nodes with the highest number of MYSTT will earn for the month. **If you earn MYSTT but do not qualify as one of the top three, do not fear - you will be able to keep your MYSTT and continue to accumulate them in the following month**, which puts you in a better position to clinch the top 3 node position for your region in the upcoming months.

**For example** - *Jane begins running a node in Turkey. In month one she accumulates 80 MYSTT. This does not place her within the top 3 nodes within her region. She continues to run her node in month two. During this period she earns another 90 MYSTT. The total number of MYSTT in her balance is 170 at the end of month two. She is now one of the top three nodes for month two based on her total amount of MYSTT accumulated. This makes her eligible for a $10 bounty payout. Once she chooses to get the bounty payout, her MYSTT balance will fall to zero and she will have to begin accumulating MYSTT starting from zero at month 3.*

**If you abuse the Mysterium Node Pilot bounty rules, you will not be paid.**

We are extremely conscious of building a resilient and robust network. This means keeping an eye out for bad actors. We see the following criteria as abuse:

1. Multiple nodes running on the same subnet
2. Artificially producing large amounts of traffic/sessions for your node. Traffic should be natural, produced by 3rd parties, Mysterium Network’s super proxy or test agent.

This list of abuse criteria will grow - we know hackers out there will continue to game the system. We’re a hacktivist team, so we expect it, but don’t expect to get paid 🤣🤣🤣
